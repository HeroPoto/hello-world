# hello-world
This is my first repository, being built as a new community member!
I'm a student in the IT career field right now, who is in need of a Bachelor's Degree to continue my career developement.
I'm 29, work full time, and am wanting to finish my college courses by the middle of 2021.
Coding is a relatively new practice for me so I'm excited to see some new material and try my hand at buiding a few simple projects!
